title: Our new paper on fluorescent DIC comes out!
date: 2022-01-08T20:17:26.159Z
summary: A new speckle pattern fabrication method is proposed in this paper, by
  using an off-the-shelf handheld inkjet printer. By printing, the speckle
  pattern quality will no longer depend heavily on the operator. A good quality
  control is achieved. This method can be used for both fluorescent and classic
  speckles preparation. The former, published on [APL
  2020](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0016384), has distinguish
  advantages and we highly recommend for general use.
