abstract: High-throughput measurement of thermal deformation and determination
  of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) using a high-resolution digital
  single lens reflex (DSLR) camera and digital image correlation (DIC) is
  described. To mitigate the mosaic effect caused by the Bayer filter of DSLR
  cameras, a color image pre-processing method, which adjusts the brightness and
  equalizes the color channels of the raw image, is carried out. In addition, a
  Gaussian pre-filtering step is adopted for denoising the images captured with
  DSLR cameras to enhance the subpixel registration accuracy. Then, by
  processing the recorded images using the state-of-the-art DIC algorithm,
  full-field displacements and strains can be determined. Compared with
  conventional industrial cameras, a DSLR camera offers not only portability,
  compactness, and economy but also much higher resolution of recorded images,
  allowing CTE characterization with higher throughput. Real experiments,
  including a verification experiment of the color image pre-processing
  technique, a benchmark CTE determination of Al alloy, and a high-throughput
  CTE determination of 15 samples of three different metals, validated the
  feasibility and accuracy of the proposed technique. The proposed method is
  cost-effective and time-saving, showing great potential in the high-throughput
  CTE measurement and other high-throughput strain measurement scenarios.
