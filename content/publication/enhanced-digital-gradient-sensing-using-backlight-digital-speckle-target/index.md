abstract: Digital gradient sensing (DGS) is a non-contact and full-field optical
  measurement technique, which assesses mechanical behaviors of transparent
  materials or specular structures by measuring angular deflections of light
  rays. However, owing to the poor light-gathering capability of its imaging
  system, the dynamic performance of DGS is heavily restricted. Here, a method
  of enhancing the dynamic performance of DGS by improving its speckle target is
  proposed. The method employs the technique of backlight illumination, which
  significantly increases the utilization efficiency of light, shorten the
  exposure time, and enhance the dynamic performance of DGS. Besides, it also
  uses the optimized digital speckle pattern to improve the measurement
  precision and accuracy. For validation, a comparison experiment was conducted,
  proving that the proposed method can improve the utilization efficiency of
  light by about 80 times and improve the quality of the speckle images by about
  40%. Real tests, including a uniaxial tension test using transmission-mode DGS
  (t-DGS) and a three-point bending test using reflection-mode DGS (r-DGS), were
  also carried out, showing the efficacy and high compatibility of the proposed
  backlight digital speckle target. In a word, this simple method greatly
  improves the performance of DGS, which can be used as a standard method in
  both t-DGS and r-DGS.
