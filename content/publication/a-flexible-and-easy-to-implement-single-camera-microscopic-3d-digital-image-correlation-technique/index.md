abstract: We propose a novel, flexible and easy-to-implement single-camera
  microscopic three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) technique for
  accurate full-field shape, motion and deformation measurements at the
  microscale. The established microscopic 3D-DIC system comprises a single 3CCD
  color camera, a high-magnification zoom lens, and a specially designed color
  separation device using a beam splitter, two optical bandpass filters and
  three plane mirrors. To perform accurate stereo measurement, color images of a
  test sample surface are recorded by the 3CCD camera, which observes the test
  sample via the microscopic imaging system from two different optical paths
  with the aid of the color separation device. The recorded color images can be
  subsequently separated to red and green channel sub-images which constitute
  stereo pairs corresponding to different perspectives. The separated stereo
  pairs can be subsequently analyzed using regular 3D-DIC to extract full-field
  3D shape and deformation of the test object surface. The method was first
  validated by a series of benchmark tests, involving the 3D shape
  reconstruction of steel balls with different diameters, in-plane and
  out-of-plane translation tests. Surface 3D deformation measurement of a planar
  acrylic plate with micro-features was also performed to show the practicality
  of the proposed method. This method provides new simple and practical avenues
  for performing shape and deformation measurement at microscale, showing great
  potential in both material testing and bio-tissue characterization.
